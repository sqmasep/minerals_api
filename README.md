# Minerals API

These days, i was in lack of inspiration, i didn't know what to do in development as a small project. I didn't want to do those basic Todo app or NFT designs

Since a long time i find geology and atoms quite interesting. You know, the way it is classified into groups and different schemas like that. I found some good design on Instagram quite recently and i was wondering if there's a way of developping a webapp with this geology theme. I did not found any API about atomic stuff or minerals/rocks. Here comes this API project, which will lead to a webapp project based on this API. Nothing too fancy or a massive complex app (i guess), but it'll be fun

## Tech choices

### API

- Express: I know how to use it,
- Prisma: By using MongoDB as a database, with Prisma you can nest objects and get the perfect data shape without refining it later, which would cause performance issue.
- Typescript: Because it's essential, fun, easy and safer during development
- ESLint: Because it's also essential, the stricter you are, the better the code will be
- Prettier: In addition to ESLint, a prettier config file is included for stylistic strictness

Contributors are welcomed to improve it

### Web

This will be the docs with interactive and detailed usage examples

- NextJS
- Tailwind
- Shadcn UI maybe (CVA, clsx)
- (...?)
