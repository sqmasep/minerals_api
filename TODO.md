## API Design

- Add "isSynthetic" field or something
- Remove "isMetal" from `family` prop

make the API url as "v1" on the first release
if there's too many requests (imagine this happens someday), i should move the express server to a Rust server and cache the results somehow, im just not good enough to do that rust server for now
